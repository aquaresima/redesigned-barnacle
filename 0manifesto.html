                    <div class="texte">After weeks of discomfort and uncertainty about the ins and outs of this project, and what was asked of us as designers, and the feeling of a disconnect with reality, I would like to propose a catalog of non-solutions. Through the demonstration of the complexity of the cocoa and chocolate industry, I would also like to question the foundations of the subject on which we were asked to work. The underlying issues; our position as designers, the management of systemic problems by a demand for local solutions, and what questions this relationship of requesting local and individual solutions in a global system raises.

                    <div class="texte">When as a designer or practitioner we are confronted with such a subject (solving world hunger) we try to find an entry point at our scale. As a group, we were interested in the chocolate production/consumption chain. Although this is only one part of the food chain, the study of cocoa production/consumption and the whole production chain is still extremely broad. In this universe, we will look for the precise, the human, the case study that will allow us to act, to take care and to develop a reflection. 
                            <br><br>
                        In the cocoa chain, there are two poles located at each  end of the chain, which allow for specific action: the producers and the consumers. On one side we  can act with the producer, favour a short production cycle, act on local issues, create cooperatives. On the other side, the consumer, namely: us, inhabitants of the Netherlands and design students. In order to raise awareness and to bring ringing light to a reality that does not affect us directly; of making our "consumer right" act. 
                        Two poles on which we can have an impact, because we act from human to human for individuals. We can take concrete action. This is important, but it can also lead to another problem that I would like to address:  the responsibility lies then with the individual.
                        <br><br>
                        When we involve a designer, we also engage an individual. This designer will, without being an expert in the system in which s/he operates, try to act on their own scale, with elements that can be grasped. There is this idea that if one person can do it on a local scale, make things happen and apply solutions locally, then everyone can do it. That we need small solutions and that pebble by pebble we move mountains. 
                        But when it is a way of working, of thinking, that is promoted by an institution, an entity that has much more weight in the system, what does it mean? Why promote individual initiatives? And why, again from an institution, encourage them?
                        The discourse crystallises around the fact that everyone can somehow find solutions, and this puts the responsibility on the individual: you just have to act if you want to change things! I would like to reorient the trajectory of this critique, and nuance a solutionist approach.
