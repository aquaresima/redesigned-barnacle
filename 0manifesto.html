                    <div class="texte">After weeks of discomfort and uncertainty about the ins and outs of this project, and what was asked of us as designers, from the Netherlands Food Partnership or the United Nations, and the feeling of a disconnect with reality, I would like to propose a catalog of non-solutions. Through the demonstration of the complexity of the cocoa and chocolate industry, I would also like to question the foundations of the subject on which we were asked to work. The underlying issues; our position as designers, the management of systemic problems by a demand for local solutions (solutions that are demanded by institutions such as the UN with a systemic scope), and what questions this relationship of requesting local and individual solutions in a global system raises.
                        This catalog will not show any solutions on my part, I want to question and criticize a solutionist system to which design is entirely part.
