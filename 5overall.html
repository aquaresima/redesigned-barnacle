                        <div class="texte">“A designer is a person who plans the look or workings of something prior to it being made, by preparing drawings or plans.
                            More formally, a designer is an agent that "specifies the structural properties of a design object". In practice, anyone who creates tangible or intangible objects, products, processes, laws, games, graphics, services, and experiences is referred to as a designer.”

                            “A journalist is an individual trained to collect/gather information in form of text, audio or pictures, processes them to a news-worth form and disseminates it to the public. The act or process mainly done by the journalist is called journalism.”

                            I would like to bring an additional layer to this project, in the way I make this knowledge public, I question the process I wanted to undertake. By questioning my positionality, I also question my relevance. I wanted to propose thoughts, bits of reflection as they are, to make my approach more transparent and, I hope, more honest.

As i start to research about it i felt into a rabbit hole of webpages and articles. None of them gave me the information i was looking for, never enough synthetize or too vague or not updated… By acknowledging that, i would like to propose a page for each case study, by curating some informations i found; higlighting the shadow part i don’t understand, and saying: i would never be exhaustive, or i couldn’t even grasp the subject as i wanted so i propose you what i found, the questions i have and you can add the content you found. Indeed, i would like people who go through the catalog to add contents, articles, ressources, links, to add comments about what i found; and so all together as non-experts we can create a shared database.
