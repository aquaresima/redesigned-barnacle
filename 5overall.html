                    <div class="texte">Chocolate, as finished or semi-finished product, is made from cocoa beans that grow on cocoa trees. The cocoa tree is a tropical species that grows at low altitudes in a hot and humid climate, preferably in regions of the world near the equator. The main countries where cocoa is cultivated are, in order of production size, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Brazil and Equator. More than 80% of the world's cocoa production comes from family farms of less than 5 hectares.
                        When the cocoa beans are ripe, they are manually removed from the pod. Then the beans are fermented and dried, then washed. It is with this raw material that the manufacture of chocolate begins. The beans are sold to large western industries such as Cargill or Barry Callebaut, who process 70% of the world's cocoa.
                        The beans are roasted, dehulled, crushed and kneaded. The chocolate is then crystallized and molded or coated. The finished product is packaged and distributed through sales channels.

                    <div class="texte">Tony's chocolate is a Dutch chocolate brand that claims to be 100% slave free. Indeed, child labor and modern slavery are the curse of the chocolate industry. As in every model of modern agriculture and supply chain this is explain by a pressure not in the middle of the chain leads by profits. Indeed, the cocoa producers are millions of small familial farms, and at the end of the chain, the consumer of chocolate who is also counts by billions. Unfortunately, the cocoa producers don’t sell directly to the consumer but have to trade with big companies who have the weight to make pressure on prices and productivity. And poverty can leads to child labor and modern slavery. Certifications or regulations are not sufficient to ensure an appropriate income for farmers.
                        <br><i>“On its own, a certification label does not enable farmers to live above the poverty line and provide a decent income for their families.”</i>
                        <br>Tony’s Chocolate proposes several principles for the companies to act. To invest in farmers cooperatives who will act locally with the farmers and therefore organize a collective force. To pay the farmers more to increase their living income. And to set up a traceability of cocoa, because during the purchase and processing of cocoa beans by western companies, certified and non-certified beans are gathered to produce chocolate.
                        <br><i>“If you buy a bar of chocolate made with certified cocoa you know that somewhere in the world the equivalent quantity of certified beans was purchased. But they're not necessarily in your bar.”</i>

                    <div class="texte">As we have seen, the production chain is very long, both because of the stages of transformation from raw material to consumption, but also because of the many actors involved. Thus actors and stages of transformation are key points that put pressure on the whole chain. Many producers and farms are involved in this massive production which will then be consumed massively, there are two distinct poles (geographical and political) on one side producers and on the other side consumers who in terms of individuals and human beings are much more numerous than the few multinationals which constrain and decide on the whole production. The market is highly inequitable.
