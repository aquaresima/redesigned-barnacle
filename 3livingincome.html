                <i>“I would disagree with any naive thought of just passing through price increases to farmers. It's unfortunately more complicated than that.”</i> 
                He said while the industry agreed that farmers needed higher incomes, <mark>It was more sustainable to empower farmers to negotiate a fairer price and to lobby producing countries to award farmers a greater percentage of the global cocoa price</mark>. This strategy has been employed by Cocoa Action, an industry initiative by manufacturers and processors including Mondelēz, Barry Callebaut and Cargill that aims to improve farmer yields through fertilizer use and training. [...] Mars’ Andy Harner said it was a naive assumption to add 3% for the price and then try to add that 3% to a cocoa farmers’ price. <i>“The supply chain really isn't that direct and transparent,”​</i> he said.

            <div class="texte">Current efforts focus on technical solutions such as increasing productivity and
                diversifying production. Though these are necessary steps, these technical
                solutions alone will not suffice. Additionally, technical approaches also
                have their own challenges, and require available and affordable inputs,
                labour and financing.[...]
                <mark>Farm gate prices are a key missing ingredient</mark>, and are a short term
                solution that every company can engage in almost immediately. <mark>The Living
                Income Differential - a $400 per tonne premium - has been implemented
                by the main cocoa growing countries Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, thereby
                raising farm gate prices by 21% and 28% respectively. This is an important
                step, although is far from sufficient to provide farmers a living income,
                despite its name</mark>. Additionally, concerns remain at the lack of inclusion of
                other stakeholders in the development of these plans, including farmer
                organisations, civil society, and other cocoa producing governments.

            <div class="texte">Other benefits are less obvious but just as valuable. <mark>The world market for cacao is marked by high price volatility. Small-scale producers end up at the mercy of market forces entirely outside their control</mark>, resulting in boom and bust cycles that at best discourage farmers from investing in growing more cacao, and at worst, bankrupt them entirely. Some of our partners offer farmers much needed stability by paying a fixed price for their beans, well above the world market price, which is set at the start of the harvest and guaranteed through the season.

            <div class="texte">I also came to appreciate the limitations of my original question. <mark>The price paid for cacao matters, but it needs to be multiplied by the volume of cacao produced in order to reveal a farmer’s total income</mark>. Similarly, income tells only half the story (or less, if the farmer gets additional money from growing coffee or other work), because if a producer sells a lot of cacao but spends a fortune on fertilizer to grow it or logistics to transport it, they may end up losing money. And all this before considering a place’s cost of living! Clearly, the more I learned, the more questions arose. [...] From my perspective, as an advocate for small farmers, I need price to be above cost of production — at least by 20 percent or more. However, we don’t know enough about cost of production and farmer incomes for coffee and cocoa. We have small data sets and handpicked examples. <mark>We need to learn the relationship between farmer income and a living income</mark>. So… yes, price is important but is still a limited indicator of sustainability and farmer livelihoods.

            <div class="texte">Until the Ivorian and Ghanaian governments combined forces to introduce
                the Living Income Differential, farmers were almost entirely dependent
                on the world market for the setting of the farm gate price. <mark>Though
                markets can work well to set proper price levels when all actors have
                countervailing power, this is not the case in the cocoa sector. One of the
                key determinants for a farmers income is therefore imposed on him. This
                asymmetrical power balance doesn’t just lead to low farm gate prices,</mark>
                it also leads to a very skewed distribution of value in the supply chain;
                farmers live in extreme poverty in a multi-billion dollar industry.

            <div class="texte">One of the arguments that companies must follow the world market
                price, is that the chocolate sector is a competitive one, and that
                companies cannot afford to unilaterally pay higher prices. However,
                in the past decade, Nestlé has bought back around $46 billion USD
                (Nestlé Global 2020) in stockholder shares. In early 2020, the Ferrero
                family paid itself an annual dividend of €642 million (Neate 2020).
                A rough calculation shows that a chocolate company like Ferrero,
                sourcing 135,000 metric tonnes of cocoa per year could give every
                single cocoa farming household it sources from (circa 90,000 farmers
                producing 1.5 tonnes per household) a living income for the year
                ($5,500 per household for Côte d’Ivoire), leading to a cost of at most
                $450 million. This would still leave the company around €192 million it
                could pay out to its owning family - the richest family in Italy.
                <mark>If chocolate companies are able to spend that kind of money on their
                stockholders and owners, there is simply no excuse for companies not
                to pay prices that ensure a living income.</mark>

            The farm gate price, the living income of farmers, the cocoa price market, the cocoa price volatility; these are the different notions that are addressed when we look at the creation of a living income for farmers.
            How can a living income or a farm price, which to be fair should be fixed and defined, coexist with a market that makes prices fluctuate?

            Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire have introduced a living income (if I understand correctly it is a farm price). The living income differential is calculated on yield forecasts, so it is not adjustable or proportional. It is a fixed income per bag of cocoa, so the farm infrastructure must be able to produce enough bags to ensure a good income for all farm workers.

            The cocoa price market is the stock price of cocoa, which sets the farm-gate price but in relation to the volatility of the cocoa price. the living income differential set up in Ghana and the Ivory Coast ensures a minimum income for farmers to protect them from market fluctuations.
